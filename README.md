**Model_Economy.py**: Defines a class that simulates an artificial economy. Parameters such as the subjective discount rate for households, depreciation rate, and production function for corporations, as well as taxes and subsidies for the government, can be specified.

**Bisection.py & Shooting_Algorithm.py**: These scripts work together to numerically solve the transition path of the artificial economy based on given parameters and initial conditions.

**Steady_State_Analysis.py**: Analyzes the steady-state values of the economy under different parameter settings.

**plot2.py & plot3.py**: Used to generate plots of the transition paths for different scenarios.
